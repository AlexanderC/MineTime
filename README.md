### Features

#### Keep all your calendars in one place

MineTime works natively with Google, Outlook.com and Microsoft Exchange: this means you can add your calendar accounts directly into MineTime.
Soon we will add support for iCloud and other CalDAV accounts.

#### Time Insights

Understanding how time is spent is important to improve future scheduling decisions.

MineTime instantly shows you how often you met your colleagues in the past months, how many times an event has been already rescheduled and much more...

#### Smart scheduling

Finding a time that works for everybody is a pain! MineTime automatically checks all participants calendars and suggests you the options that are likely to work best.

You privacy is important to us and MineTime will never show other people your calendar!


#### Schedule events using natural language

MineTime's assistant understands what you say. You can easily schedule new events or perform actions on the calendar by using the most intuitive interface: English.

#### Cross-platform experience

MineTime is a calendar built on Electron, allowing it to run natively on Windows, Mac and - yes! - Linux. Enjoy the same smooth experience across all three!
